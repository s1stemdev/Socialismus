# Description

A plugin made **by players for players**, designed to make communicating more convenient and modern. You can do exactly
what
you want with this plugin, as it offers many different features and great customization of all settings and messages!

## Features

- **Chats:** Allows the user to communicate with other people in the neighbourhood with messages that are formatted in
  an unusual way and when you move the mouse over a message, a miracle happens. You can restrict the use of the chat by
  setting many different requirements, such as permissions and the current world.
- **Swapper:** Allows you to create many placeholders for chat. For example, you can make emojis or shortcuts.
- **BubbleChat:** Simple packet-based messages over players' heads, allowing you to chat without looking at the chat!
  Experience a smooth bubble transition when the player runs, it's not what you've seen in other plugins.

## Information

- Integrates with PlaceholderAPI, allowing you to use placeholders from that plugin directly in messages.
- Displays statistics from your own server and from other servers if you have enabled bStats on your server.
